For a technology so powerful, artificial intelligence has been kept strangely powerless. Today's models can reason with incredible sophistication, yet they can't act. They can pass the bar exam but can't book a table for dinner. They can debug code but can't order more printer ink.

This is AI's "last mile"—the frustrating gap between a brilliant plan and real-world action. It exists because the modern internet wasn't built for agents. It was built for people, and it’s a maze of closed APIs, proprietary platforms, and walled gardens that trap the live data needed to actually *do* things.

For years, this has bottlenecked the true potential of AI.

Today, we're breaking that bottleneck wide open.

### Announcing Epicuri: The Open Internet for Autonomous Action

We are thrilled to introduce **Epicuri**, the permissionless, open, and universally accessible protocol for real-world action. Epicuri is the missing piece of the puzzle—a public registry for everything the web can do, designed specifically for autonomous agents.

With Epicuri, any business—from a global airline to a local bakery—can publish its real-world capabilities directly: available seats, live inventory, open appointments, and current menus. This information is live, machine-readable, and instantly discoverable by any AI agent, anywhere.

For AI, this changes everything. Instead of hitting a wall, agents find a pathway. Instead of getting stuck in a planning loop, they execute.

### No More Gatekeepers. No More Tolls.

The old model of the internet forced businesses to pay intermediaries like DoorDash, Ticketmaster, and Amazon huge fees just to access their own customers and data. This model is a tax on innovation, and its days are numbered.

Epicuri dismantles it. We believe real-time data belongs to those who create it. By making capabilities open, we enable a world with:

* **Fairer Economics:** Restaurants keep their margins instead of paying 30% commissions. Venues sell tickets directly without inflated marketplace fees.
* **Smarter Supply Chains:** Businesses exchange inventory information openly, triggering automatic restocking before a shelf ever goes empty.
* **True Innovation:** The benefits of AI flow to those who build, not to the gatekeepers who hoard access.

A future where AI is stuck behind paywalls makes no sense. The age of autonomous agents demands an internet that is immediate, accurate, and direct. Epicuri is building it.

### Built on a Foundation of Trust

Epicuri is designed around three pillars for a new, agent-native internet:

* **Openness:** Any provider can publish, and any AI can access. No gatekeepers. No hidden fees.
* **Autonomy:** Agents discover and execute tasks automatically, with no need for custom, hand-coded integrations for every single service.
* **Trust:** Providers stake real economic incentives behind their capabilities. Reliable services gain visibility and reputation, while poor performers are penalized. This creates a self-regulating network built on accountability, not opaque reviews.

### The Future of Action is Open. Join Us.

This is just the beginning. The internet is being rebuilt for an autonomous future, and we are inviting you to build it with us.

Over the coming weeks, we'll share deep dives into the Epicuri protocol, live demos of agents performing complex, multi-step tasks, and details on how we use the Aptos blockchain to guarantee trust and performance.

The future doesn't belong to those who build walls. It belongs to those who build bridges.

**Be part of the new internet:**

* **Request Early Access** on our website.
* **Providers and Platforms:** Reach out to us directly to learn how you can publish your capabilities and free your customers from aggregator fees.
* **Investors:** See how we're building the next foundational layer of the internet.

Let's break AI's last mile, together.
