For a technology so powerful, artificial intelligence remains strangely limited. Today's large-language models (LLMs) can draft documents, debug code, and answer complex questions with striking ease. They confidently write essays, explain molecular biology, and pass bar exams. And yet, when asked to do something as straightforward as ordering printer ink, booking a dental appointment, or updating a restaurant's daily specials online, these same systems stumble helplessly.

This is AI's "last mile"—the gap between reasoning and real-world execution. It's the invisible barrier that prevents agents from moving beyond mere advice and into direct action. And as long as this gap remains, all the extraordinary potential of modern AI is bottlenecked, leaving businesses and consumers to struggle through an endless tangle of manual tasks.

At Epicuri, we see clearly why this last mile persists, and we've set out to remove it.

## What Keeps the Last Mile Closed?

The friction holding back AI doesn't lie in its reasoning ability. The models know exactly what to do. They understand the task, and they understand the steps to achieve it. The friction lies elsewhere: in how the web itself is structured.

Today's internet is a patchwork of closed-door APIs, proprietary marketplaces, and walled-garden platforms, each jealously guarding the live, real-time data needed to act. Want to know how many seats are left at tonight's concert, or if your supplier has enough parts in stock? Chances are you're paying an aggregator or marketplace—like Ticketmaster, Amazon, or Uber Eats—a hefty premium just to access your own data. Even the simple act of updating a restaurant menu online means paying a marketplace a substantial cut for the privilege.

Humans navigate this friction by brute force: opening tabs, manually checking availability, price-comparing, logging into multiple portals, copying, pasting, and clicking. Recently, attempts have been made to teach AI agents to replicate this human brute-force method—giving them access to browsers and using visual inference to figure out exactly where to click on pages designed explicitly for human eyes. While this works at a minimal level, it's incredibly inefficient, requires enormous computational power, and remains prohibitive at any meaningful scale. For language models, these human-style workarounds represent yet another inefficient barrier. Each hidden API and marketplace barrier becomes an insurmountable wall, stopping effective autonomous action before it even begins.

As the capabilities of AI expand, paradoxically, so does the value of this barrier. The more efficiently AI plans and reasons, the more valuable it becomes for gatekeepers to hoard access to the last mile. Without a fundamental shift, the benefits of AI risk flowing not to those who innovate, but to those who control access.

## How Epicuri Opens the Last Mile

Epicuri removes the friction of the last mile by creating something the internet has needed for a long time—a permissionless, open, and universally accessible registry of real-time capabilities. Think of it as a public directory for everything the web can do, always updated, always available, never behind paywalls or proprietary logins.

With Epicuri, any business—from a global airline to a single-location bakery—can directly publish its capabilities: available seats, live menus, open appointment slots, inventory levels, delivery availability. This information is open and machine-readable, accessible instantly to any AI agent, anywhere in the world.

For AI agents, this changes everything. Instead of encountering barriers, they discover pathways. Instead of stalled planning, they have immediate execution. Rather than writing an elaborate but ultimately futile plan, agents can act in real-time, reaching through Epicuri's open network to complete real-world tasks automatically.

## Real-Time Data Belongs to You, Not the Gatekeepers

What does this mean practically? It means restaurants no longer pay intermediaries 30% just to reach their own customers. It means event venues can sell seats directly, without marketplaces inflating prices with artificial scarcity. It means suppliers and businesses exchange inventory information openly, automatically restocking before shelves go empty. It means better margins, more reliable supply chains, and fairer economics for everyone involved.

We believe this transparency is inevitable—not just because it's fair, but because the very nature of AI demands it. A future where AI remains stuck behind gatekeepers makes little sense. AI thrives on immediacy, accuracy, and direct access. The business models built on withholding that access can't survive long-term—not in a world increasingly shaped by autonomous agents.

## Epicuri's Three Pillars: Openness, Autonomy, Trust

We've built Epicuri around three fundamental principles:

- **Openness:** Any provider can publish, and any AI can access, the real-time capabilities they need—no gatekeepers, no hidden fees.
- **Autonomy:** AI agents automatically discover, select, and execute capabilities without specialized training or hand-coded integrations. They see the world as clearly and openly as humans do, but act much faster and more reliably.
- **Trust:** Providers stake real economic incentives behind their capabilities. Reliable services gain visibility, while poor performers get rapidly penalized. This built-in accountability replaces opaque reviews and biased marketplace rankings.

Together, these pillars form the foundation for a fair, efficient, and agent-native internet—one designed explicitly for the needs of autonomous systems.

## What's Next and How You Can Join

This article is just the beginning. Over the coming weeks, we'll share deeper explorations of how Epicuri's open registry works in practice, why we chose to build it on the Aptos blockchain, how agents plan without specialized training, and how providers can begin publishing today.

You'll see a live demonstration of an AI agent planning complex tasks in real-time—from simple orders to multi-step operations involving multiple providers—and adjusting dynamically as situations change.

Most importantly, we're inviting you to join us. If you're an investor looking at the next foundational technology, an AI platform looking to enhance your agents' capabilities, or a SaaS provider who wants your customers free from aggregator fees, we want your feedback and partnership.

Join us in redefining what's possible—let's break AI's last mile wide open and build an internet where innovation, not gatekeeping, determines the future.
