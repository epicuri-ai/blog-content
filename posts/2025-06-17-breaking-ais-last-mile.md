For a technology so powerful, artificial intelligence has remained strangely powerless. Today's large-language models (LLMs) can draft essays, debug complex code, and even pass bar exams, yet they falter at seemingly simple tasks like ordering printer ink, booking dental appointments, or updating restaurant menus.

This frustrating gap—AI's "last mile"—exists between sophisticated reasoning and real-world execution. It's not due to limitations in AI's intelligence but because today's internet was designed for human users, not autonomous agents. It is a fragmented landscape of closed-door APIs, proprietary marketplaces, and restrictive walled gardens, each guarding the real-time data necessary for practical actions.

Until now, this barrier has constrained AI's extraordinary potential, leaving businesses and consumers struggling through manual, inefficient processes.

### Announcing Epicuri: The Open Internet for Autonomous Action

Today, we're thrilled to announce **Epicuri**, a innovative open, permissionless protocol explicitly designed for autonomous real-world action. Epicuri acts as a universal registry, allowing any business—from global airlines to local bakeries—to directly publish real-time capabilities. Information such as seat availability, live inventory, open appointments, and dynamic menus becomes instantly accessible and actionable by any AI agent, anywhere.

For AI agents, Epicuri transforms obstacles into opportunities. Rather than being trapped in endless planning loops, agents now seamlessly discover and execute tasks.

### No More Gatekeepers. No More Tolls.

The current internet model relies heavily on intermediaries like DoorDash, Ticketmaster, and Amazon, charging substantial fees merely to connect businesses with their customers. This model is a significant drain on innovation and economic efficiency.

Epicuri fundamentally changes this:

- **Fairer Economics:** Restaurants retain their profits instead of losing significant revenues to intermediaries. Venues can directly sell tickets without inflated marketplace fees.
- **Optimized Supply Chains:** Open sharing of real-time inventory data allows automatic restocking, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness.
- **Empowered Innovation:** By removing gatekeeper friction, AI's full potential is unlocked and directed towards true innovators.

A future constrained by gatekeepers is unsustainable. The agent-centric future demands immediacy, accuracy, and direct access—exactly what Epicuri delivers.

### Built on Openness, Autonomy, and Trust

Epicuri is founded on three critical pillars:

- **Openness:** Businesses freely publish and agents freely access real-time capabilities without gatekeepers or hidden fees.
- **Autonomy:** AI agents autonomously discover, select, and execute capabilities without specialized integrations.
- **Trust:** Providers stake economic incentives behind their capabilities, ensuring reliable services are promoted and subpar offerings quickly penalized. This built-in accountability creates a self-regulating, trustworthy ecosystem.

### Real-Time Data Belongs to Innovators, Not Gatekeepers

Practically, Epicuri ensures:
- Restaurants stop losing profits to high commission rates.
- Event organizers directly manage ticket sales without artificial scarcity.
- Supply chains optimize automatically, eliminating costly manual checks and shortages.

Transparency isn't just ideal—it's inevitable, driven by the demands of autonomous AI.

### Join the Autonomous Revolution

We're reshaping the internet for the autonomous future, and this is only the beginning. Over the coming weeks, we'll explore Epicuri’s technology in-depth, including live demonstrations of autonomous agents performing complex, multi-step tasks, and our innovative use of the Aptos blockchain to ensure reliability and transparency.

We invite:
- **Providers and Platforms** to start publishing your capabilities and freeing your customers from intermediaries.
- **Investors** to recognize the next foundational technology shaping the internet’s future.

Together, let's break AI's last mile wide open. The future doesn't belong to those who build walls—it belongs to those who build bridges.

**Join us.**
