# Breaking AI's Last Mile: Building the Open Internet for Autonomous Action

For a technology so powerful, artificial intelligence remains strangely limited. Today's LLMs can draft documents and debug code, yet stumble when asked to book appointments or order supplies.

## The Problem with Current AI

The friction holding back AI doesn't lie in reasoning ability. The models know what to do. The friction lies in how the web itself is structured.

### Walled Garden APIs

Proprietary marketplaces jealously guard live, real-time data needed for autonomous action. These gatekeepers create artificial barriers that prevent AI agents from accessing the information they need to function effectively.

### The Gatekeeper Tax

Aggregators charge hefty premiums just to access your own data and capabilities. This creates an unnecessary layer of cost and complexity that stifles innovation and limits the potential of autonomous systems.

### Brute Force Workarounds

Current AI agents rely on browser automationâ€”inefficient and prohibitive at scale. This approach is like using a sledgehammer when you need a scalpel, creating unnecessary overhead and unreliability.

## How Epicuri Opens the Last Mile

A permissionless, open, and universally accessible registry of real-time capabilities. Think of it as a public directory for everything the web can do.

### Direct Publishing

Any business can directly publish capabilities: available seats, live menus, appointment slots, inventory levels. This eliminates the need for intermediaries and creates direct connections between service providers and AI agents.

### Instant Discovery

AI agents automatically discover and execute capabilities without specialized training or hand-coded integrations. This creates a truly autonomous ecosystem where AI can adapt and learn in real-time.

### Economic Incentives

Built on Aptos blockchain with staking mechanisms that ensure reliability and trust. Economic incentives align all participants toward maintaining a high-quality, reliable network.

## The Future is Autonomous

The convergence of AI capabilities, market pressure, and infrastructure standards creates a unique window for building the open internet for autonomous action. Epicuri is positioned to be the foundational layer that enables this transformation.
